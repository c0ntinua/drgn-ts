I'm working with a friend to implement a generalization of Chess, primarily by including a new 'multi-piece' called a 'dragon.'

I'm using this project to learn Typescript and play with ideas that may end up in the code for that project. 

Recently I've been using traditional chess pieces to represent the dragon, with king => head, pawn => body, and castle => armor. 
The big theme is conncetedness. The dragon is both the wire and the electrons.

The queen represents another new (single) piece, the 'thetan,' which moves like a king twice in the same turn. 

A teleport piece appeared in earlier versions and will appear again. 

You can experiment with this code (a recentish version of it) below.

For 'font unicode reasons', it looks better on Firefox than it does on Chrome.
